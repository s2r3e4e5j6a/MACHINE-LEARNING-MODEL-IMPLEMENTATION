NAME: SREEJA GURRALA

INTERN ID:CT04DM1389

DOMAIN: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:During this internship, I gained valuable hands-on experience in the implementation of machine learning (ML) models, which deepened my understanding of both theoretical concepts and real-world applications. The focus was on designing, training, validating, and deploying models to solve specific problems using datasets from domains such as healthcare, finance, and retail.

This internship provided an excellent opportunity to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry practices. I developed critical skills such as data preprocessing, model evaluation (using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix), hyperparameter tuning, and model optimization. It also emphasized the importance of understanding the business context when applying machine learning solutions.

Overall, this experience strengthened my ability to work independently and collaboratively on technical projects, making it a significant step in my journey toward becoming a machine learning engineer.
Applications like Image Classification,Natural Language Processing (NLP),Healthcare Predictions.
